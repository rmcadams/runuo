Getting started with RunUO is relatively easy and will take you approximately five minutes from start to finish to get logged into your server.  

*Assumptions:*

  * We will assume that you're installing RunUO on the same machine with the Ultima Online Client.
  * We will assume you already have Ultima Online installed and working.
  * We will assume you've already downloaded the latest RunUO release
  * We will assume you have a "power user" level of knowledge when it comes to your computer
  * We will assume you've already installed the .NET framework listed above in the requirements section.

*Instructions:*

   # Extract the latest RunUO release to your desktop folder
   # Open up RunUO\Scripts\Misc\Datapath.cs in notepad
   # Modify your path to include the directory to which you installed Ultima Online as shown:[http://www.runuo.com/ryan/runuo_tutorial_datapath.png]
   # Save the edits to Datapath.cs and overwrite the existing file.
   # Double click "RunUO.exe" in your RunUO folder to start your shard, you will be prompted to create your "Owner" level account as shown:[http://www.runuo.com/ryan/runuo_tutorial_owner.png]
   # Enter in a username and password of your choosing as shown:[http://www.runuo.com/ryan/runuo_tutorial_running.png]
   # Launch [http://www.assistuo.com AssistUO] and point it at your local computer (the IP is shown below in the red box):[http://www.runuo.com/ryan/runuo_tutorial_running_ip.png]

At this point you should be able to log in and do whatever you'd like with your shard!  This is how easy it is to have your own server with RunUO!
